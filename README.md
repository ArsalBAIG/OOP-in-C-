# OOP-in-C++
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C++ is a programming paradigm that organizes code using objects and classes. It supports key concepts like encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction. OOP makes C++ programs more modular, reusable, and easier to manage, especially for large-scale software development.
